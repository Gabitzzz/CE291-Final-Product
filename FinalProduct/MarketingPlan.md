**Distribution**

As this is not a conventionally sold product, it is difficult to talk about the marketing aspects. Ideally this product would be made and distributed privately to different NHS hospitals, with no cost to it as they have supplied us with the information necessary to come up with it. The source code for the product would not be available to them, and so we would just distribute the finished version of the product in which they can utilise for tracking Covid cases.

**Competition**

There is some market competition to something like this, but it is mostly comprised of freeware as most people see something like this as a joint effort against the pandemic. There would not be much need for advertising or making this product as publicly known as possible, since it's use is mostly limited to people who want to deal with Covid directly, and so is therefore a pretty pointless product to the general public. 

**Marketing strategy**

The primary source for knowing about this program would be word of mouth/testomonies from people who already have access to it and can attest to it's usefulness. As mentioned before, the primary target 'market' for this software would be medical professionals who need it to tackle against Covid-19, although it would still be openly available to anyone who requested for something like this.
