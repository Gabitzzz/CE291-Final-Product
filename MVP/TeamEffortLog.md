3. Christides, Xenios

- Sprint 1 - Managed to understand the idea of the project so I could explain some things to my teammates and give some initial thoughts about the design and extra features that we could try to add.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-8

- Sprint 2 - - Had to create with my team a class where everyone had to print their names including me, which this was a test to see that all the members had the same GitLab version on IntelliJ.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-10

- Sprint 3 - Managed to do a basic Frame because it was asked for sprint 3 so the supervisor could see it, but after a lot of modifications, I removed it to make a better one using graphs for our project.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-29

- Sprint 4 - My task was to manage to display graphs about cases and deaths of Covid19.   
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-32

- Sprint 5 - Managed to fix the errors of the axes so the data that was displayed was based on the files that we had from the website of the government.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-34

- MVP Sprint - Contributed to create the linear regression model so our system could make a prediction, also I added some extra features which could be useful for a customer to see it.

6. Sun, Xiaoyi

- Sprint 1 - To use git commands from CMD line I tried to do it on my own machine. Needed to download the CMD developer tool which is 11 GB then failed to install it due to the extraction tool. Then I used VMware but failed to open README.md by default text-editor, eventually got some information from online and managed to do it. Took 2 hours to do it.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-3

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-17

- Sprint 3 - Summarized and documented basic functional requirements and some extra functions needed for the product, made it clearly what are the tasks we need to complete. It took two hours.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-27

- Sprint 4 - Made a rough line chart with x, y axis and random y values and points due to difficulty on having to read file to arrays then plot the array values in the chart.
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-31

- Sprint 5 - Absent due to three other assignments due in the week

- MVP Sprint - The lines for cumulative total cases line chart was horizontally lined above the highest y value, having worked through, it shows correctly the cumulative values for both charts.
