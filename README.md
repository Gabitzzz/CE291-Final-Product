**1. How to compile and run our code**

First of all we must navigate to the src folder from within GitLab and then download the src folder. After the foler is downloaded and extracted we then navigate to this folder from within the command prompt and then run the following command.

```javac Team31\*.java```

```java Team31.Main```
