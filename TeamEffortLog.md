3. Christides, Xenios

- Sprint 1 - Managed to understand the idea of the project so I could explain some things to my teammates and give some initial thoughts about the design and extra features that we could try to add.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-8

- Sprint 2 - - Had to create with my team a class where everyone had to print their names including me, which this was a test to see that all the members had the same GitLab version on IntelliJ.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-10

- Sprint 3 - Managed to do a basic Frame because it was asked for sprint 3 so the supervisor could see it, but after a lot of modifications, I removed it to make a better one using graphs for our project.  
https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-29

- Sprint 4 - My task was to manage to display graphs about cases and deaths of Covid19.

https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A291040-34

- MVP Sprint - Contributed to create the linear regression model so our system could make a prediction, also I added some extra features which could be useful for a customer to see it.
