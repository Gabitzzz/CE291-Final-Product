# Team 31 - Team Project Challenge

### 1. Project Brief
The data analytics department of the NHS has asked you to help them analyse COVID-19 data. More precisely, to analyse the number of daily COVID-19 infections and deaths, and to build a model that forecasts infections and deaths in the coming weeks. This will help them to make appropriate preparations and ensure that the healthcare system can cope with the demand.

To do this, the NHS wants you to build a computer system that reads the publicly available UK COVID-19 data from CSV files (more information on the data files below). The system should convert the raw data into a report that can be read by the NHS management and easily interpreted. The report should include visualisations of the data and/or summary statistics, which achieve the following objectives:

- The reports should include some statistics to describe the weekly development of COVID-19 infections and death
- There should be some visualisations of the COVID-19 data. The visualisation should also include modeling and forecasting results.
- The report should summarize the expected (forecasted) number of infections and deaths in the next 2, 4 and 6 week time frames (more information and suggestions on how to model and forecast the data below).

The final reports should be presented in a suitable format for the NHS to be able to read easily, in PDF format and/or displayed on the screen. These are the rough requirements for the system, given by the NHS. The way you design your system to achieve these goals is up to you, but the NHS would welcome constructive ideas and engagement with you as your agile creation of your solution emerges.

The clients would welcome any useful extras that your team can think of in developing the system, provided they are feasible to be implemented to a high quality within the project's timescale. They will especially appreciate any features that aid them in their central objective, i.e. making informed analysis and forecast of COVID-19 development, but other features aiding a smoothly operating system, including good GUI interface design, will be appreciated too.
