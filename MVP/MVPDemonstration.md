###### Features we are particularly proud of:

-	We made some functions to represent the maximum and minimum cases and deaths below the graphs that happened in that range of weeks; 
-	We predicted the future cases and deaths up to 10 weeks from the present.


##### A part of the functionality shown in the screenshots that is currently incomplete is the graph that is showing the number of weeks instead of exact dates.
##### As we partially finished prediction system, we will aim to accomplish a more accurate prediction for the final product.
