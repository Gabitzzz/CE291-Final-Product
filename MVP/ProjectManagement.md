# Project Management Log

### Project management discussion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our team’s attendance was one of the highest among all the teams with an average of 95% as show in the CE291 – Team Project Meeting. We accomplished to have 7 extra meetings on our spare time. In those meetings we organized very well and shared the tasks equally, so that we worked efficiently. Even if one of the team’s members were absent, the rest of the members informed him about their meeting’s discussions and prepared him for the next task.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we mention that team members have contributed on each other’s tasks, so we achieved to prepare better solutions for the encountered errors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the scrum meetings, we temporarily worked online due to COVID-19 Pandemic and face-to-face meeting would have been more efficient due to connection problems, lagging, hardware.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One communication issue that we had during the meetings is hardware issues such as microphone functionality.

### Burndown-Charts Discussion

The burn-down charts show the amount of work that has been completed in the sprints and the work remaining.

We can improve our velocity ability in future sprints by making the tasks clearer and give a reasonable estimate of time.
