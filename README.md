**1. How to compile and run our code**

First of all we must download the repository from GitLab, after the repository is downloaded and extracted we then navigate to the src folder within command prompt and then run the following command.

```javac Team31\*.java```

This will compile all of the .java files from within the Team31 folder. Next now run the class files by doing the following.

```java Team31.Main```

This is how you compile and run our code.
